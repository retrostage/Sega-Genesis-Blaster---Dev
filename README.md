# Sega-Genesis-Blaster---Dev

This is for people wanting to create custom Sega Genesis / MD games using ROM sizes up to 32MByte (256Mbit), developed with the Sega Genesis Blaster by RetroStage. It is functionally the same as the SSF2 mapper, but with extra capability.

This programmable cartridge is capable of using an extended version of the SSF2 mapper, which allows games up to 32MByte in size (128MByte technically achievable, but not yet implemented in hardware) to be made, along with SRAM ability for save games.

The guide here covers all that should be needed to let the dev know:
1) What the registers are, and
2) How to use them

More info on the SSF2 mapper can be found here : https://segaretro.org/SSFII_Genesis_Technical_Information_(2000-07-26)

Any questions can be sent to me at support@retrostage.net
